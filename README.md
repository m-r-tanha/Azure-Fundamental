- Use a **compute instance** as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud for machine learning. They can also be used as a compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing purposes.
- Azure Machine Learning compute instance enables you to author, train, and deploy models in a fully integrated notebook experience in your workspace.
You can run Jupyter notebooks in VS Code using compute instance as the remote server with no SSH needed. You can also enable VS Code integration through remote SSH extension.
- You can install packages and add kernels to your compute instance.
